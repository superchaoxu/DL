So first, it does that, and then the second step, is it computes $a_1^{[1]} = \\sigma (z_1^{[1]} )$, like so. So, for both $z$ and $a$, the notational convention is that the $[l]$ here in superscript square brackets, refers to the layer number, and the $[i]$ subscript here, refers to the nodes in that layer.

    "In the last section, you have learned how to compute the prediction on a neural network, given a single training example. In this section, you will learn how to vectorize across multiple training examples. And the outcome will be quite similar to what you learned for logistic regression. Whereby stacking up different training examples in different columns of the matrix, you'd be able to take the equations you had from the previous section. And with very little modification, change them to make the neural network compute the outputs on all the examples on pretty much all at the same time. So let's see the details on how to do that.\n",

    "- the sigmoid function goes between zero and one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I would say never use this except for the output layer if you're doing binary classification or maybe almost never use this. And the reason I almost never use this is because the tanh is pretty much strictly superior. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **tanh function** (tangent function / hyperbolic tangent function)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(z) = \\dfrac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- the tanh function goes between $(-1, 1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This almost always works better than the sigmoid function because with values between plus one and minus one, the mean of the activations that come out of your hidden layer are closer to having a zero mean. And so just as sometimes when you train a learning algorithm, you might center the data and your data have zero mean using a **tanh** instead of a sigmoid function. Kind of has the effect of centering your data so that the mean of your data is close to 0 rather than 0.5. And this actually makes learning for the next layer a little bit easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The one ***exception*** is for the **output layer** because if $y$ is either zero or one ($y \\in (0,1)$), then it makes sense for $\\hat{y}$ to be a number that you want to output that's between zero and one rather than between -1 and 1. So the one exception where I would use the sigmoid activation function is when you're using binary classification. In which case you might use the sigmoid activation function for the upper layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the downsides of both the sigmoid function and the tanh function is that if $z$ is either very large or very small, then the gradient of the derivative of the slope of this function becomes very small. So if $z$ is very large or $z$ is very small, the slope of the function either ends up being close to zero and so this can slow down gradient descent. So one other choice that is very popular in machine learning is what's called the rectified linear unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ReLU function** (Rectified Linear unit)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g(z) = \\text{max}(0, z)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- So the derivative is one so long as $z$ is positive and derivative or the slope is zero when $z$ is negative. If you're implementing this, technically the derivative when $z$ is exactly zero is not well defined. But when you implement this in the computer, the odds that you get exactly $z$ equals $0.000000000000000$ is very small. So you don't need to worry about it. In practice, you could pretend a derivative when $z$ is equal to zero, you can pretend is either one or zero. And you can work just fine. So the fact is not differentiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One disadvantage of the ReLU is that the derivative is equal to zero when $z$ is negative. In practice this works just fine. But there is another version of the value called the Leaky ReLU.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$g(z) = \\text{max}(0.01z, z)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- And you might say, why is that constant $0.01$? Well, you can also make that an another parameter of the learning algorithm. And some people say that works even better, but how they see people do that. So, if you feel like trying it in your application, please feel free to do so. And you can just see how it works and how well it works, and stick with it if it gives you a good result. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This usually works better than the ReLU activation function. Although, it's just not used as much in practice. Either one should be fine. Although, if you had to pick one, I usually just use the ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The advantage of both the ReLU and the Leaky ReLU is that for a lot of the space of $z$, the derivative of the activation function, the slope of the activation function is very different from zero. And so in practice, using the value activation function, your neural network will often learn much faster than when using the tanh or the sigmoid activation function. And the main reason is that there is less of this effect of the slope of the function going to zero, which slows down learning. And I know that for half of the range of $z$ in ReLU, the slope for value is zero. But in practice, enough of your hidden units will have $z$ greater than zero. So learning can still be quite fast for most training examples.\n",

And then for all other units, the ReLU or the rectified linear unit is increasingly the default choice of activation function. So if you're not sure what to use for your hidden layer, I would just use the ReLU activation function, is what you see most people using these days. Although sometimes people also use the tanh activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things we will see in deep learning is that you often have a lot of different choices in how you build your neural network. Ranging from a number of hidden units to the choices activation function, to how you initialize the ways. A lot of choices like that. And it turns out that it is sometimes difficult to get good guidelines for exactly what will work best for your problem. So throughout these courses, I'll keep on giving you a sense of what I see in the industry in terms of what's more or less popular. But for your application, with your applications, idiosyncrasies is actually very difficult to know in advance exactly what will work best. So common piece of advice would be, if you're not sure which one of these activation functions work best, try them all. And evaluate on a holdout validation set or a development set. And see which one works better and then go of that. And I think that by testing these different choices for your application, you would be better at future proofing your neural network architecture against the idiosyncracies problems. As well as evolutions of the algorithms rather than, if I were to tell you always use a value activation and don't use anything else. That just may or may not apply for whatever problem you end up working on. \n",

    "If $\\mathbf{W}$ is too large, you're more likely to end up even at the very start of training, with very large values of $\\mathbf{z}$. Which causes your tanh or your sigmoid activation function to be saturated, thus slowing down learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Turns out that we usually prefer to initialize the weights to very small random values. Because if you are using a tanh or sigmoid activation function, or the other sigmoid, even just at the output layer. If the weights are too large, then when you compute the activation values, remember that $\\mathbf{z}^{[1]} = \\mathbf{W}^{[1]} \\mathbf{a}^{[0]} + \\mathbf{b}^{[1]}$. And then $\\mathbf{a}^{[1]} $ is the activation function applied to $\\mathbf{z}^{[1]}$. So if $\\mathbf{W}$ is very big, $\\mathbf{z}$ will be very, or at least some values of $\\mathbf{z}$ will be either very large or very small. And so in that case, you're more likely to end up at these **flat parts** of the tanh function or the sigmoid function, where the slope or the gradient is very small. Meaning that gradient descent will be very slow. So learning was very slow. \n",

    "If you don't have any sigmoid or tanh activation functions throughout your neural network, this is less of an issue. But if you're doing binary classification, and your output unit is a sigmoid function, then you just don't want the initial parameters to be too large. So that's why multiplying by 0.01 would be something reasonable to try, or any other small number. \n",
