    "Logistic regression is a very \"shallow\" model, whereas the model, with five hidden layers for example, is a much deeper model, and shallow versus depth is a matter of degree. So neural network of a single hidden layer, this would be a 2 layer neural network. Remember when we count layers in a neural network, we don't count the input layer, we just count the hidden layers as was the output layer. So, a 2 layer neural network is still quite shallow, but not as shallow as logistic regression. Technically logistic regression is a one layer neural network, but over the last several years the AI, on the machine learning community, has realized that there are functions that very deep neural networks can learn that shallower models are often unable to.\n",

So for this exercise you actually store in your cache to $\\mathbf{z}$ as well as $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.
