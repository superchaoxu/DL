    "\n",
    "1. In the modern big data era, where you might have a million examples in total, then the trend is that your **dev and test sets** have been becoming a **much smaller percentage** of the total. Because remember, the goal of the dev set or the development set is that you're going to test different algorithms on it and see which algorithm works better. So the dev set just needs to be big enough for you to evaluate, say, two different algorithm choices or ten different algorithm choices and quickly decide which one is doing better. And you might not need a whole 20\\% of your data for that. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t- For example, if you have a million training examples, you might decide that just having 10,000 examples in your dev set is more than enough to evaluate, you know, which one or two algorithms does better. And in a similar vein, the main goal of your test set is, given your final classifier, to give you a pretty confident estimate of how well it's doing. And again, if you have a million examples, maybe you might decide that 10,000 examples is more than enough in order to evaluate a single classifier and give you a good estimate of how well it's doing. So, in this example, where you have a million examples, if you need just 10,000 for your dev and 10,000 for your test, your ratio will be more like...this 10,000 is 1\\% of 1 million, so you'll have 98\\% train, 1\\% dev, 1\\% test. And I've also seen applications where, if you have even more than a million examples, you might end up with, you know, 99.5\\% train and 0.25\\% dev, 0.25\\% test. Or maybe a 0.4\\% dev, 0.1\\% test. \n",
    "\n",
    "\t- When setting up your machine learning problem, I'll often set it up into a train, dev and test sets, and if you have a relatively small dataset, these traditional ratios might be okay. But if you have a much larger data set, it's also fine to set your dev and test sets to be much smaller than your 20\\% or even 10\\% of your data.\n",

But by having too much flexibility in the middle, it somehow overfits those two examples in the middle as well. So this classifier kind of has high bias, because it was mostly linear, but you need maybe a curve function or quadratic function. And it has high variance, because it had too much flexibility to fit, you know, those two mislabel, or those aligned examples in the middle as well. In case this seems contrived, well, this example is a little bit contrived in two dimensions, but with very high dimensional inputs. You actually do get things with high bias in some regions and high variance in some regions.

    ">  Putting `find a new NN architecture` in parentheses because one of those things that, you just have to try, maybe you can make it work, maybe not. Whereas, getting a bigger network almost always helps, and training longer, well, doesn't always help, but it certainly never hurts. So when training a learning algorithm, I would try these things until I can at least get rid of the bias problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Notice\n",
    ":class: hint\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Depending on whether you have high bias or high variance, the set of things you should try could be quite different. So I'll usually use the training-dev set to try to diagnose if you have a bias or variance problem, and then use that to select the appropriate subset of things to try. So, for example, if you actually have a high bias problem, getting more training data is actually not going to help. Or, at least it's not the most efficient thing to do. So being clear on how much of a bias problem or variance problem or both, can help you focus on selecting the most useful things to try.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. in the earlier era of machine learning, there used to be a lot of discussion on what is called the bias variance tradeoff. And the reason for that was that, for a lot of the things you could try, you could increase bias and reduce variance, or reduce bias and increase variance. But, back in the pre-deep learning era, we didn't have many tools, we didn't have as many tools that just reduce bias, or that just reduce variance without hurting the other one. But in the modern deep learning, big data era, so long as you can keep training a bigger network, and so long as you can keep getting more data, which isn't always the case for either of these, but if that's the case, then getting a bigger network almost always just reduces your bias, without necessarily hurting your variance, so long as you regularize appropriately. And getting more data, pretty much always reduces your variance and doesn't hurt your bias much. So what's really happened is that, with these two steps, the ability to train, pick a network, or get more data, we now have tools to drive down bias and just drive down bias, or drive down variance and just drive down variance, without really hurting the other thing that much. And I think this has been one of the big reasons that deep learning has been so useful for supervised learning, that there's much less of this tradeoff where you have to carefully balance bias and variance, but sometimes, you just have more options for reducing bias or reducing variance, without necessarily increasing the other one. And, in fact, so last, you have a well-regularized network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Training a bigger network almost never hurts. And the main cost of training a neural network that's too big is just computational time, so long as you're regularizing. \n",

    "- One of the first things you should try is probably **regularization**. \n",
    "- The other way to address high variance is to **get more training data** that's also quite reliable. But you can't always get more training data, or it could be expensive to get more data. \n",
    "\n",
    "But adding regularization will often help to prevent overfitting, or to reduce variance in your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's develop these ideas using logistic regression. Recall that for logistic regression, you try to minimize the cost function $J$, $\\text{min}_{w,b} \\ \\boldsymbol{J}(w,b)$ which is defined as this:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter. And usually, you set this using your development set, or using hold-out cross validation. When you try a variety of values and see what does the best, in terms of trading off between doing well in your training set versus also setting that two normal of your parameters to be small, which helps prevent over fitting. So lambda is another hyper parameter that you might have to tune.\n",

Because if you look at your parameters, $w$ is usually a pretty high dimensional parameter vector, especially with a high variance problem. Maybe $w$ just has a lot of parameters, so you aren't fitting all the parameters well, whereas $b$ is just a single number. So almost all the parameters are in $w$ rather than $b$. And if you add this last term, in practice, it won't make much of a difference, because $b$ is just one parameter over a very large number of parameters. In practice, we usually just don't bother to include it. But you can if you want. \n",

And some people say that this can help with compressing the model, because the set of parameters are zero, then you need less memory to store the model. Although, I find that, in practice, L1 regularization, to make your model sparse, helps only a little bit. So I don't think it's used that much, at least not for the purpose of compressing your model. And when people train your networks, L2 regularization is just used much, much more often.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Increasing $\\lambda$, the matrices $W$ will be reasonably close to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "\t- One piece of intuition is maybe it'll set the weight to be so close to zero for a lot of hidden units that's basically zeroing out a lot of the impact of these hidden units. This much simplified neural network becomes a much smaller neural network. This will take you from the overfitting case, much closer to the other high bias case. But, hopefully, there'll be an intermediate value of lambda that results in the result closer to this \"just right\" case in the middle.\n",
    "\t- However, the intuition of completely zeroing out a bunch of hidden units isn't quite right. It turns out that what actually happens is it'll still use all the hidden units, but each of them would just have a much smaller effect. But you do end up with a simpler network, and as if you have a smaller network that is, therefore, less prone to overfitting. \n",
