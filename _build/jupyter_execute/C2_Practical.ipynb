    "Welcome to your first assignment. This exercise gives you a brief introduction to Python. Even if you've used Python before, this will help familiarize you with the functions we'll need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "- You will be using Python 3.\n",
    "- Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.\n",
    "- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**After this assignment you will:**\n",
    "- Be able to use iPython Notebooks\n",
    "- Be able to use numpy functions and numpy matrix/vector operations\n",
    "- Understand the concept of \"broadcasting\"\n",
    "- Be able to vectorize code\n",

    "Before submitting your assignment to the AutoGrader, please make sure you are not doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have not added any _extra_ `print` statement(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "2. You have not added any _extra_ code cell(s) in the assignment.\n",
    "3. You have not changed any of the function parameters.\n",
    "4. You are not using any global variables inside your graded exercises. Unless specifically instructed to do so, please refrain from it and use the local variables instead.\n",
    "5. You are not changing the assignment code where it is not required, like creating _extra_ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do any of the following, you will get something like, `Grader Error: Grader feedback not found` (or similarly unexpected) error upon submitting your assignment. Before asking for help/debugging the errors in your assignment, check for these first. If this is the case, and you don't remember the changes you have made, you can get a fresh copy of the assignment by following these [instructions](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/supplement/iLwon/h-ow-to-refresh-your-workspace)."
