You might have an input of an image, and want to output a label to recognize this image as either being a cat, in which case you output 1, or not-cat in which case you output 0, and we're going to use $y$ to denote the output label. Let's look at how an image is represented in a computer. \n",

Although to make this as an small example here, I drew these as much smaller matrices, so these are actually 5 by 4 matrices rather than 64 by 64 ($5\\times4\\times3$). \n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) = - \\Big( y^{(i)} \\  \\text{log}(\\hat{y}^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)}) \\ \\text{log}(1-\\hat{y}^{(i)}) \\Big)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that if we are using squared error then you want to square error to be as small as possible. And with this logistic regression, lost function will also want this to be as small as possible. To understand why this makes sense, let's look at the two cases:\n",

But because $\\hat{y}$ is you know the sigmoid function, it can never be bigger than one. So this is saying that if $y = 1$, you want $\\hat{y}$ to be as big as possible, but it can't ever be bigger than one. So saying you want, $\\hat{y}$ to be **close to one** as well.\n",

And then through a similar piece of reasoning, you can conclude that this loss function is trying to make $\\hat{y}$ as small as possible, and again, because $\\hat{y} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ . This is saying that if $y = 0$ then your loss function will push the parameters to make $\\hat{y}$ as **close to zero** as possible.\n",

Because when you come to learn the parameters, you find that the optimization problem, which becomes non-convex. So you end up with optimization problem, you are with multiple local optima.

    "\n",
    "The interpretation is $\\hat{y} = \\mathrm{P}(y=1\\mid x)$. So we want our algorithm to output $\\hat{y}$ has the chance that $y = 1$ for a given set of input features $x$. So another way to say this is that if $y$ is equal to 1 then the chance of $y$ given $x$ is equal to $\\hat{y}$,  and conversely if $y$ is equal to 0 then the chance that y was 0 was $1-\\hat{y}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if $\\hat{y}$ was a chance that $y = 1$, then $1-\\hat{y}$ is the chance that $y = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what I'm going to do is take these two equations which basically define $\\mathrm{P}(y \\mid x)$ for the two cases of $y = 0$ or $y = 1$. And then take these two equations and summarize them into a single equation. And just to point out $y$ has to be either $0$ or $1$ because in binary cost equations, $y = 0$ or $y = 1$ are the only two possible cases. When someone take these two equations and summarize them as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{P}(y \\mid x) = \\hat{y}^y \\  (1-\\hat{y})^{(1-y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because the $\\text{log}$ function is a strictly monotonically increasing function, your maximizing $\\text{log} \\ \\mathrm{P}(y \\mid x)$ should give you a similar result as optimizing $\\mathrm{P}(y \\mid x)$. So:\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is actually negative of the loss function that we had to find previously. And there is a negative sign there because usually if you are training a learning algorithm, you want to make probabilities large. Whereas in logistic regression, we want to minimize the loss function. So minimizing the loss corresponds to maximizing the log of the probability. So this is what the loss function on a single example looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is what the loss function on a single example looks like. How about the cost function, the overall cost function on the entire training set on m examples? Let's figure that out. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cost on m example\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability of all the labels In the training set. If you assume that the training examples I've drawn independently or drawn IID, identically independently distributed, then the probability of the example is the product of probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{P}(\\text{labels in training set}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{m} \\mathrm{P}(y^{(i)} \\mid x^{(i)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And so if you want to carry out maximum likelihood estimation, then you want to find the parameters that maximizes the chance of your observations at training set. But maximizing this is the same as maximizing the log, so we just put logs on both sides:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And so in statistics, there's a principle called the principle of maximum likelihood estimation, which just means to choose the parameters that maximizes $\\text{log} \\ \\mathrm{P}$. Or in other words, that maximizes this $\\text{log} \\ \\mathrm{P}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this justifies the cost we had for logistic regression which is $\\boldsymbol{J}(w,b) $:\n",

    "\n",
    "Because we now want to minimize the cost instead of maximizing likelihood, we've got to rid of the minus sign. And then finally for convenience, to make sure that our quantities are better scale, we just add a 1 over $m$ extra scaling factor there. But so to summarize, by minimizing this cost function $\\boldsymbol{J}(w,b) $ we're really carrying out maximum likelihood estimation with the logistic regression model.

    "Vectorization is basically the art of getting rid of explicit for loops in your code. In the deep learning era, especially in deep learning in practice, you often find yourself training on relatively large data sets, because that's when deep learning algorithms tend to shine. And so, it's important that your code very quickly because otherwise, if it's training a big data set, your code might take a long time to run then you just find yourself waiting a very long time to get the result. So in the deep learning era, I think the ability to perform vectorization has become a key skill. Let's start with an example.\n",

    "In logistic regreesion, you need to solve this kind of problem:\n",

    "$$z = w^T x + b \\quad \\text{where } w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_x},  x \\in  \\mathbb{R}^{n_x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w$ was this column vector and $x$ is also this vector. Maybe they are very large vectors if you have a lot of features. So, $w$ and $x$ were both $\\mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ dimensional vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to compute $w$ transpose $x$, if you had a ***non-vectorized*** implementation, you would do something like `for` loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "z = 0\n",
    "for i in range (n_x):\n",
    "\tz += w[i] * x[i]\n",
    "z += b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a non-vectorized implementation. Then you find that that's going to be really slow. In contrast, a ***vectorized*** implementation would just compute $w$ transpose $x$ directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "z = np.dot(w,x) + b\n",

They're sometimes called SIMD instructions. This stands for a single instruction multiple data. But what this basically means is that, if you use built-in functions such as this `np.dot()` function or other functions that don't require you explicitly implementing a `for` loop. It enables Phyton `Numpy` to take much better advantage of parallelism to do your computations much faster.  And this is true both computations on CPUs and computations on GPUs. It's just that GPUs are remarkably good at these SIMD calculations but CPU is actually also not too bad at that. Maybe just not as good as GPUs. \n",

Now, the first thing I want to do is show how you can compute $z^{(1)}$, $z^{(2)}$, $z^{(3)}$ and so on, all in one step, in fact, with one line of code. So, I'm going to construct a $1 \\times m$ matrix that's really a row vector while I'm going to compute $z^{(1)}$, $z^{(2)}$, and so on, down to $z^{(m)}$, all at the same time. \n",

I'm going to define capital $Z$ to be this where you take the lowercase $z$'s and stack them horizontally. So when you stack the lower case $x$'s corresponding to a different training examples, horizontally you get this variable capital $X$ and the same way when you take these lowercase $z$ variables, and stack them horizontally, you get this variable capital $Z$.\n",

    "Now there is a subtlety in Python, which is at here `b` is a real number or if you want to say you know $1 \\times 1$ matrix, is just a normal real number. But, when you add this vector to a real number, Python automatically takes this real number `b` and expands it out to this  $1 \\times m$ row vector (i.e. $[b, b, \\cdots, b]$). So in case this operation seems a little bit mysterious, this is called **broadcasting** in Python.\n",

    "What we've seen in this section is that instead of needing to loop over $m$ training examples to compute lowercase $z$ and lowercase $a$, one of the time, you can implement this one line of code, to compute all these $z$'s at the same time. And then, this one line of code, with appropriate implementation of lowercase Sigma to compute all the lowercase $a$'s all at the same time. So this is how you implement a vectorize implementation of the forward propagation for all $m$ training examples at the same time. \n",

    "In this matrix, it shows the number of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in 100 grams of four different foods:\n",

    "---\n",
    "height: 100px\n",

    "So for example, a 100 grams of apples turns out, has 56 calories from carbs, and much less from proteins and fats. Whereas, in contrast, a 100 grams of beef has 104 calories from protein and 135 calories from fat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say your goal is to calculate the percentage of calories from carbs, proteins and fats for each of the four foods. So, for example, if you look at this column and add up the numbers in that column you get that 100 grams of apple has 56 plus 1.2 plus 1.8 so that's 59 calories. And so as a percentage the percentage of calories from carbohydrates in an apple would be 56 over 59, that's about 94.9\\%. So most of the calories in an apple come from carbs, whereas in contrast, most of the calories of beef come from protein and fat and so on. So the calculation you want is really to sum up each of the four columns of this matrix to get the total number of calories in 100 grams of apples, beef, eggs, and potatoes. And then to divide throughout the matrix, so as to get the percentage of calories from carbs, proteins and fats for each of the four foods. So the question is, can you do this without an explicit for-loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "What I'm going to do is show you how you can set, say this matrix equal to three by four matrix $A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- And then with one line of Python code we're going to sum down the columns. So we're going to get four numbers corresponding to the total number of calories in these four different types of foods, 100 grams of these four different types of foods. \n",

So technically you don't need to call reshape here again, so that's actually a little bit redundant. But when I'm writing Python codes if I'm not entirely sure what matrix, whether the dimensions of a matrix I often would just call a reshape command just to make sure that it's the right column vector or the row vector or whatever you want it to be. The reshape command is a constant time. It's a order one operation that's very cheap to call. So don't be shy about using the reshape command to make sure that your matrices are the size you need it to be.\n",

So, how can you divide a three by four matrix by a one by four matrix? Or by one by four vector? Let's go through a few more examples of broadcasting. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you take a 4 by 1 vector and add it to a number, what Python will do is take this number and auto-expand it into a four by one vector as well, as follows. And so the vector [1, 2, 3, 4] plus the number 100 ends up with that vector on the right. You're adding a 100 to every element, and in fact we use this form of broadcasting where that constant was the parameter $b$ in an earlier section. And this type of broadcasting works with both column vectors and row vectors, and in fact we use a similar form of broadcasting earlier with the constant we're adding to a vector being the parameter $b$ in logistic regression. \n",

So the general case would be if you have some $(m,n)$ matrix here and you add it to a $(1,n)$ matrix. What Python will do is copy the matrix $m$ times to turn this into $m$ by $n$ matrix, so instead of this one by three matrix it'll copy it twice in this example to turn it into this. Also, two by three matrix and we'll add these so you'll end up with the sum on the right. So you taken, you added 100 to the first column, added 200 to second column, added 300 to the third column.

    "\n",
    "1. Here's the more general principle of broadcasting in Python. If you have an $(m,n)$ matrix and you add or subtract or multiply or divide with a $(1,n)$ matrix, then this will copy it $m$ times into an $(m,n)$ matrix. And then apply the addition, subtraction, and multiplication of division element wise. \n",
    "\n",
    "   If conversely, you were to take the $(m,n)$ matrix and add, subtract, multiply, divide by an $(m,1)$ matrix, then also this would copy it now $n$ times. And turn that into an $(m,n)$ matrix and then apply the operation element wise. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Just one of the broadcasting, which is if you have an $(m,1)$ matrix, so that's really a column vector like $[1,2,3]^T$, and you add, subtract, multiply or divide by a row number. So maybe a $(1,1)$ matrix. So such as that plus 100, then you end up copying this real number $m$ times until you'll also get another $(m,1)$ matrix. And then you perform the operation such as addition on this example element-wise. And something similar also works for row vectors.\n",

    "The first command that we ran, just now. And this created a data structure with `a.shape` was this funny thing $(5,)$ so this is called a rank 1 array. And this is a very funny data structure. It doesn't behave consistently as either a row vector nor a column vector, which makes some of its effects nonintuitive. So what I'm going to recommend is that when you're doing your programing exercises, or in fact when you're implementing logistic regression or neural networks that you just do not use these rank 1 arrays.\n",
